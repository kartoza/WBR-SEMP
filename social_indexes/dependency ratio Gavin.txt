Gavin's dependency ratio calculations in field calculator

Ratio_employed =  "employed" /( "unemployed" + "dosicoraged_worker_seeker" + "not_economically_active" + "less_than_15" )

ratio_inverse = 1/ratio_employed

Score =

case 
when ratio_inverse < 1 then 0
when ratio_inverse is null and employed = 0 and ( "unemployed" + "dosicoraged_worker_seeker" + "not_economically_active" + "less_than_15" ) = 0 then 0
when ratio_inverse is null and employed = 0 and ( "unemployed" + "dosicoraged_worker_seeker" + "not_economically_active" + "less_than_15" ) > 0 then 10
when ratio_inverse is null and employed > 0 then 0
else (ratio_inverse - 1)/(maximum(ratio_inverse) - 1)*10
end

score_adjusted_by_area = 
score/area

score_adjusted = 
score_adjusted_by_area/maximum(score_adjusted_by_area)*10

this gives a nice quantile spread, whose classes you can reclassify 1-10
